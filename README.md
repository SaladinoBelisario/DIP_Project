# Final project for the Digital Image Processing class

## About:
This project it's about performing a lane detection using a 
combination of filters (Computer Vision) in order to detect the 
lanes in an arbitrary image. I know machine learning its
more precise, but takes a lot of time in order to produce 
results, moreover, needs big datasets.
